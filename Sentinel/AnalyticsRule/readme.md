# Creating Sentinel Analytic Rules based on Office DLP Policies
The script will generate new Analytic rules used for alerting in connection to Office DLP policies. If the script is run more than once it will update the existing rules.

### Prerequisites

- **MUST** have ingested both SharePoint and Exchange events to Azure Sentinel or rule creation will fail with error 500.

### Running the Script

1. Please use the instructions in Endpointdlp to deploy the function.
        
## Additional Customization

If you need to customize the KQL query either modify the associated template file ruletemplate.yaml or create your own custom template.
